To use the photo gallery web app just download the code, you must have ionic installed and run in the folder with the code:

``` $ ionic serve

And you will be redirected to the web app in a localhost

If you'd like to try and build the web app enter the ionic website https://ionicframework.com/docs/react/your-first-app

Hope it helps! :)
